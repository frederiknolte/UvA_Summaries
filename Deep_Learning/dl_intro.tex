\subsubsection{Perceptron}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Single perceptron weights every element of the input with a weight, and adds a bias term
	\item Step function as output: if input sum greater zero, then output is 1, else 0 (or -1)
	\item Problem: can only learn linear problems and not e.g. XOR
	\item Overcoming by multi-layer perceptron 
\end{itemize}
